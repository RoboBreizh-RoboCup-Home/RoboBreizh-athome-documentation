# Introduction

This documentation explains the architecture of the project, the different modules and how to use them.

Within our project we use the [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) framework, allowing us to use and create modules for our needs in a flexible manner.
As we use the ROS 1 Framework, knowing Python 3 and c++ are a pre-requisite.
